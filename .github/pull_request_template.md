Please, go through these steps when you submit a PR:

1. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/{JIRA-TICKET}` or `feature/{JIRA-TICKET}` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/SOC-731/signin-issue` or `feature/SOC-741/new-emoji-strip`.

2. If you have added any new dependency, youâ€™ve tested it with a release APK for proguard failures.

3. Give a descriptive title to your PR. It SHOULD include the JIRA ticket number (in caps) at the starting of the PR in square brackets. For example:
`[SOC-542] Grid view image optimizations`. If there is no JIRA ticket and this is a developer story or fix, use `[NO-CARD]` in that case.
